Day 4
~~~~~~~~
MERGE CONFLICT;

one file, two branches, two developers

Dev1	----> Branch 1		----> "code.txt"	----> JAVA Code
Dev2	----> Branch 2		----> "code.txt"	----> PYTHON Code
When we merge ---> conflict occurs because both developers changed the same file

FORKING A REPO;
git clone		----> will download the entire code from the remote repo to local repo
git pull		----> it will pull ONLY the changes made in the remote repo

CREATING A GITHUB PROFILE

GIT STASH

11.00 AM	----> TL ----> Do this work (Create a file with name called demo.py, and write some python code, and add it and commit it)
										STILL GOING ON

11.30 AM	----> TL ----> Don't do the previous work (11.00 AM), we have one immediate work (create a file, add and commit) which should be completed

You shouldn't push the partially completed work

git stash is used to store the partially completed work in a temporary location

Note: To apply git stash, atleast one commit should be made
